# Focus Timer ⏱️

A calm, human-centered focus timer designed to encourage steady attention without pressure.

This project is not about productivity hacks or aggressive optimization.
It’s about staying present, focused, and supported during a single work session.

## ✨ What it does
- Runs a real focus countdown timer
- Shows a gentle motivational message every 10 minutes:
  > *“Good job. Stay focused on your goal.”*
- Keeps the interface clean and distraction-free
- Encourages focus without forcing productivity

## 🎯 Why this project?

Something that quietly reminds you you’re doing well, without breaking your flow.
