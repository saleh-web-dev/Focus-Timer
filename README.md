# ⏱️ Focus Timer

A simple focus timer built to help you work with intention, not pressure.

This project is part of my personal learning journey as a junior web developer.
It’s intentionally minimal — no clutter, no overengineering — just a calm space to focus.

Sometimes all you need is:
- a clear timer
- a simple interface
- and fewer distractions

## 🛠️ Built with
- HTML

Small improvements will be added step by step.

Made with focus ☕
